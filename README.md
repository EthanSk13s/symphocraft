# Symphocraft

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>In the Distance, that day, when the Star became Music...</i></p>

A mod inspired by Symphogear, where the player is granted the ability to bear relic fragments and become Valkyries.

## Current Features
- **Symphogears** - the bulk of the mod, equip amulets, bearing relic fragments crafted from extremely rare Relic Ore, to transform to a Symphogear representing the fragments of a relic
- **Song Mode** - while in a Symphogear, enter into Song Mode to perform various predefined combos, which can executed by inputting specific directional inputs in time with the beat of your Symphogear's music.

# Prerequisites
- Fabric 1.18.2
- GeckoLib

# Install
~~Build it yourself~~ Work in Progress, please understand.

# Tidbit
I initially created this mod to kill time and after watching a bit of Symphogears; being unsatisfied with the state of Minecraft combat. I decided to try my hand at an interesting take and take "some" inspiration from the anime and have a go at it.

# Progress
**TL;DR: Barely any content :) Repo is currently for progress tracking.**

Currently, everything is a work in progress. As more things get polished and developed (Mainly fleshing out Song mode and incorporating rhythm), Adding Symphogears would be the next part to tackle. The number of Symphogears planned to be added depends on how far I am in the anime, and which ones I want to focus on. Balancing is an issue that I don't want to focus on right now, since there are no mobs balanced around the Symphogears (since they are literally superhuman forms). Right now, this repository is mainly for tracking and backing up progress for this mod.
